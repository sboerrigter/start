# Todo

A list of things I want to get done before building my first website with this project:

- Better solution for PHP in HTML formatting (Laravel Pint?)
- Gallery styling
- Related posts
- Do a lighthouse test and fix issues
- Hannah site to separate repository

# Low priority

Other things I might want to add later:

- Register a custom post type (testimonials?)
- Register a custom taxonomy
- Sidebar
- Cookie consent
