# Todo

A list of things I want to get done before building my first website with this project:

- Related posts
- Do a lighthouse test and fix issues
- Add Tailwind/CSS import globbing (https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/12336, https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/6688#discussioncomhment-3649999, https://github.com/dimitrinicolas/postcss-import-ext-glob)
- Better solution for PHP in HTML formatting (Laravel Pint?)

# Low priority

Other things I might want to add later:

- Register a custom post type (testimonials?)
- Register a custom taxonomy
- Sidebar
- Cookie consent
